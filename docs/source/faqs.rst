Kornia relation to Other Computer Vision Projects
-------------------------------------------------

The project mimics some of the functionalities found in OpenCV. Eventhough
the project is bacekd up by the `OpenCV.org <www.opencv.org/>`_, there is no
intention at all to merge in any form both projects. *Kornia* is ment to
provide differentiable operators to train nets, while *OpenCV* scope is inference.
