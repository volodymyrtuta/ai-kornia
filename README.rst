`Documentation <https://arraiy.github.io/torchgeometry/>`_

The *PyTorch Geometry* package is a geometric computer vision library for `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.

It consists of a set of routines and differentiable modules to solve generic geometry computer vision problems. At its core, the package uses *PyTorch* as its main backend both for efficiency and to take advantage of the reverse-mode auto-differentiation to define and compute the gradient of complex functions.

Development Setup
=================

Assuming that you are on ubuntu 16.04, with nvidia-drivers installed.

In bash, source the ``path.bash.inc`` script.  This will install a
local conda environment under ``./.dev_env``, which includes pytorch
and some dependencies (no root required).

.. code:: bash

   source ./path.bash.inc
   python -c "import torchgeometry; print(torchgeometry.__version__)"


To install, or update the conda environment run ``setup_dev_env.sh``

.. code:: bash

   ./setup_dev_env.sh

Quick Usage
===========

.. code:: python

 import torch
 import torchgeometry as tgm

 x_rad = tgm.pi * torch.rand(1, 3, 3)
 x_deg = tgm.rad2deg(x_rad)

 torch.allclose(x_rad, tgm.deg2rad(x_deg))  # True

Examples
========

Run our Jupyter notebooks `examples <https://github.com/arraiy/torchgeometry/tree/master/examples/>`_ to learn to use the library.


Installation
============

**From pip:**

.. code:: bash

    pip install torchgeometry
